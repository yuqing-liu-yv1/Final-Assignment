      <section>
        <p>
          The event featured presentations from wellness coaches and volunteer distributors, plant based food and drink tasting, and blood type testing. By talking about nutrition facts and life experiences of combating weight loss and chronic conditions, Akanna brought the awareness of “eating according to your blood type” to the Bronzeville community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the African American community, the most concerning health conditions are chronic: heart diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, inflammation and arthritis. Many learn for the first time that a carefully planned diet tailored to your blood type, or just knowing your blood type, can not only improve health but also elevate your lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, major medical centers such as Harvard Health say there is limited scientific evidence that blood type alone should determine what people eat. Yet even without full scientific validation, people are not holding back about jumping on this health trend, as individuals report feeling better on these diets.

            Melissa Boston Atoyebi, the 52 year old CEO of Akanna, shared that she did not know her blood type and “never thought it would matter,” until she survived a near death experience in her early 20s. She learned that diet plays a big part in wellness for different blood types from reading the book “Eating for Your Blood Types” by Peter J. D’Adamo.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Nobody ever told me my blood type could be connected to my health,” she said. “I grew up eating heavy meat meals because that is what my O type mom made. But when I learned I am Type A, I realized my body was not made for that.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspired by her own experience, Atoyebi started Akanna in March 2019 designing nutrition and detox products for different blood types. Akanna then folded blood type education into its mission in 2021 as a way to connect everyday habits with health outcomes by launching the “Battle of the Blood Type” campaign.

        <h2>Blood type and chronic health in the African American community</h2>
        <p>
          According to the American Red Cross Blood Service, about 51 percent of people in the African American community in the U.S. are Type O, which often supports a meat heavy diet and an outgoing social culture. Yet many residents in Bronzeville do not know their blood type until they order a specific test, which is a pricey process and is not covered by most health insurance.

          To make Akanna’s products accessible and affordable to the community, Atoyebi said she and her team have “always worked to fight for offering prices that were highly competitive” and brought education and awareness of blood type based diet with food tasting. At each of their events, participants are offered a blood type test included in their 10 dollar entry ticket.

          “For the blood type testing, we offer it for educational purposes,” said Atoyebi. “They are saving a lot of money just running your blood type through us versus trying to move the doctor.”

          Gerald West Sr., a resident of the South Side, was introduced by his son Gerald West Jr., a volunteer distributor, to Akanna. “One of the things that I appreciate is that they introduced me to ‘eating for your blood,’” he said, mentioning that he is Type A. “I did find that it was a huge health benefit for me to follow some of the protocols.” He is following his son’s advice that “everybody should pursue it slowly and intentionally.”

          “Speaking with the doctor is great. Teaming with the doctor is awesome,” said Gerald West Jr., when talking about his work at Akanna.

            Atoyebi said Akanna now structures its programs around cleansing and food routines tailored to customers, sharing what to buy, what to eat, and three products meant to address mucus, parasites and colon cleansing. They also offer community spaces with spa facilities upstairs for customers to destress and take care of their mental health.

            Delores Irvin, an 83 year old South Side resident, has been working with Akanna as a volunteer distributor since the company started in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Education, exposure, and just company - community and family - is what gets you through the Depression, through hard times,” said Irvin. “And that is what Akanna is. It is family, a community. And we keep building and bringing new people to our community.”
